#BASIC CALCULATOR V1
Calculator V1: created two variables Value1 & Value2, i hard coded two int to the variables and created another variable that will be use to sum value1 and value2 and then print sum

#BASIC CALCULATOR V2
Calculator V2: copied the content of V1 to V2 in the V2 the code was made to prompt user to enter the input of Value1 and Value and then print the sum but it keeps passing a logical error it was conacating the Value1 and Value2 instead of adding up the values

#BASIC CALCULATOR V3
Calculator v3: Copied V2 to V3, Here i fixed the logical error in V2 i change the type of variable for Value1 and Value2 to an int type data so the user can only enter a integer so now Value1 + Value2 will add the value and not concating the value but whenver i made use to a decimal place value i get a invalid error cause Value1 and Value2 was hard coded to int values.

#BASIC CALCULATOR V4
Calculator V4: Here in V4 i had to debug V3 so i copied V3 to V4, in V4 i need to hard code sum to a float so it will be able to let user input decimal place number and sum then to the the correct value with decimal places
